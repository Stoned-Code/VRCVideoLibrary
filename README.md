## Adding Videos
1. Go into the "UHModz" directory that should have been created in your "VRChat" directory after your first launch.
2. In the "UHModz" directory there should be a text file called "Videos.txt", open that with a text editor.
3. Format your text document like so and save, `Button Name|Video Url`. Example below. (Must restart VRChat if it's open)
